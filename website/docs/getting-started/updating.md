# Updating & Uninstalling

## Updating

Update to the latest version with a single command:

```bash
AnyDeals update
```

This pulls the latest code, updates dependencies, and prompts you to configure any new options that were added since your last update.

:::tip
`AnyDeals update` automatically detects new configuration options and prompts you to add them. If you skipped that prompt, you can manually run `AnyDeals config check` to see missing options, then `AnyDeals config migrate` to interactively add them.
:::

### What happens during an update

When you run `AnyDeals update`, the following steps occur:

1. **Pairing-data snapshot** — a lightweight pre-update state snapshot is saved (covers `~/.AnyDeals/pairing/`, Feishu comment rules, and other state files that get modified at runtime). Recoverable via the snapshot restore flow described under [Snapshots and rollback](../user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback.md), or by extracting the most recent quick-snapshot zip Anydeals wrote next to your `~/.AnyDeals/` directory.
2. **Git pull** — pulls the latest code from the `main` branch and updates submodules
3. **Dependency install** — runs `uv pip install -e ".[all]"` to pick up new or changed dependencies
4. **Config migration** — detects new config options added since your version and prompts you to set them
5. **Gateway auto-restart** — running gateways are refreshed after the update completes so the new code takes effect immediately. Service-managed gateways (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS) are restarted through the service manager. Manual gateways are relaunched automatically when Anydeals can map the running PID back to a profile.

### Preview-only: `AnyDeals update --check`

Want to know if you're behind `origin/main` before actually pulling? Run `AnyDeals update --check` — it fetches, prints your local commit and the latest remote commit side-by-side, and exits `0` if in sync or `1` if behind. No files are modified, no gateway is restarted. Useful in scripts and cron jobs that gate on "is there an update".

### Full pre-update backup: `--backup`

For high-value profiles (production gateways, shared team installs) you can opt into a full pre-pull backup of `ANYDEALS_HOME` (config, auth, sessions, skills, pairing):

```bash
AnyDeals update --backup
```

Or make it the default for every run:

```yaml
# ~/.AnyDeals/config.yaml
updates:
  pre_update_backup: true
```

`--backup` was the always-on behavior in earlier builds, but it was adding minutes to every update on large homes, so it's now opt-in. The lightweight pairing-data snapshot above still runs unconditionally.

Expected output looks like:

```
$ AnyDeals update
Updating Anydeals Agent...
📥 Pulling latest code...
Already up to date.  (or: Updating abc1234..def5678)
📦 Updating dependencies...
✅ Dependencies updated
🔍 Checking for new config options...
✅ Config is up to date  (or: Found 2 new options — running migration...)
🔄 Restarting gateways...
✅ Gateway restarted
✅ Anydeals Agent updated successfully!
```

### Recommended Post-Update Validation

`AnyDeals update` handles the main update path, but a quick validation confirms everything landed cleanly:

1. `git status --short` — if the tree is unexpectedly dirty, inspect before continuing
2. `AnyDeals doctor` — checks config, dependencies, and service health
3. `AnyDeals --version` — confirm the version bumped as expected
4. If you use the gateway: `AnyDeals gateway status`
5. If `doctor` reports npm audit issues: run `npm audit fix` in the flagged directory

:::warning Dirty working tree after update
If `git status --short` shows unexpected changes after `AnyDeals update`, stop and inspect them before continuing. This usually means local modifications were reapplied on top of the updated code, or a dependency step refreshed lockfiles.
:::

### If your terminal disconnects mid-update

`AnyDeals update` protects itself against accidental terminal loss:

- The update ignores `SIGHUP`, so closing your SSH session or terminal window no longer kills it mid-install. `pip` and `git` child processes inherit this protection, so the Python environment cannot be left half-installed by a dropped connection.
- All output is mirrored to `~/.AnyDeals/logs/update.log` while the update runs. If your terminal disappears, reconnect and inspect the log to see whether the update finished and whether the gateway restart succeeded:

```bash
tail -f ~/.AnyDeals/logs/update.log
```

- `Ctrl-C` (SIGINT) and system shutdown (SIGTERM) are still honored — those are deliberate cancellations, not accidents.

You no longer need to wrap `AnyDeals update` in `screen` or `tmux` to survive a terminal drop.

### Checking your current version

```bash
AnyDeals version
```

Compare against the latest release at the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/NousResearch/AnyDeals-agent/releases).

### Updating from Messaging Platforms

You can also update directly from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, or Teams by sending:

```
/update
```

This pulls the latest code, updates dependencies, and restarts running gateways. The bot will briefly go offline during the restart (typically 5–15 seconds) and then resume.

### Manual Update

If you installed manually (not via the quick installer):

```bash
cd /path/to/AnyDeals-agent
export VIRTUAL_ENV="$(pwd)/venv"

# Pull latest code and submodules
git pull origin main
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Reinstall (picks up new dependencies)
uv pip install -e ".[all]"
uv pip install -e "./tinker-atropos"

# Check for new config options
AnyDeals config check
AnyDeals config migrate   # Interactively add any missing options
```

### Rollback instructions

If an update introduces a problem, you can roll back to a previous version:

```bash
cd /path/to/AnyDeals-agent

# List recent versions
git log --oneline -10

# Roll back to a specific commit
git checkout <commit-hash>
git submodule update --init --recursive
uv pip install -e ".[all]"

# Restart the gateway if running
AnyDeals gateway restart
```

To roll back to a specific release tag:

```bash
git checkout v0.6.0
git submodule update --init --recursive
uv pip install -e ".[all]"
```

:::warning
Rolling back may cause config incompatibilities if new options were added. Run `AnyDeals config check` after rolling back and remove any unrecognized options from `config.yaml` if you encounter errors.
:::

### Note for Nix users

If you installed via Nix flake, updates are managed through the Nix package manager:

```bash
# Update the flake input
nix flake update AnyDeals-agent

# Or rebuild with the latest
nix profile upgrade AnyDeals-agent
```

Nix installations are immutable — rollback is handled by Nix's generation system:

```bash
nix profile rollback
```

See [Nix Setup](./nix-setup.md) for more details.

## Uninstalling

```bash
AnyDeals uninstall
```

The uninstaller gives you the option to keep your configuration files (`~/.AnyDeals/`) for a future reinstall.

### Manual Uninstall

```bash
rm -f ~/.local/bin/AnyDeals
rm -rf /path/to/AnyDeals-agent
rm -rf ~/.AnyDeals            # Optional — keep if you plan to reinstall
```

:::info
If you installed the gateway as a system service, stop and disable it first:
```bash
AnyDeals gateway stop
# Linux: systemctl --user disable AnyDeals-gateway
# macOS: launchctl remove ai.AnyDeals.gateway
```
